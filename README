This repository contains the code written for the Harrison College code test
provided on April 29th 2014. Co-located with this README is the file provided
by Harrison College with the code test instructions.

To use the code in this repository I suggest using virtualenv with virtualenvwrapper
to create isolated environments for each of the code bases for the three questions.
That way if there are any conflicting dependencies with your current environment
this code won't get in the way. For each of the questions code bases there is a
file 'requirements.pip' with specific requirements for each code base, and all
of these can be installed from the file using.

   pip install -r requirements.pip
